To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of sweatshirts the company makes each year.

Given information:
- The company has 4 different kinds of sweatshirts.
- The company makes 60,000 of each kind of sweatshirt each year.

To find the total number of sweatshirts, we need to multiply the number of kinds of sweatshirts by the number of sweatshirts of each kind.

Total number of sweatshirts = Number of kinds of sweatshirts × Number of sweatshirts of each kind
Total number of sweatshirts = 4 × 60,000
Total number of sweatshirts = 240,000

Therefore, the company makes 240,000 sweatshirts each year.
