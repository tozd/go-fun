To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of trading cards sold by the hobby store in June.

Given information:
- The hobby store normally sells 10,576 trading cards per month.
- In June, the hobby store sold 15,498 more trading cards than normal.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of trading cards sold in June.
Total trading cards sold in June = Normal monthly sales + Additional sales in June
Total trading cards sold in June = 10,576 + 15,498
Total trading cards sold in June = 26,074

Therefore, the hobby store sold a total of 26,074 trading cards in June.
