To solve this problem, we need to find the number of dishes the restaurant can make and then calculate the remaining cutlets.

Given information:
- The restaurant receives a shipment of 86 veal cutlets.
- It takes 3 cutlets to make a dish.

Step 1: Find the number of dishes the restaurant can make.
Number of dishes = Total number of cutlets / Number of cutlets per dish
Number of dishes = 86 / 3
Number of dishes = 28.67

Since we can't make a partial dish, we round down the number of dishes to the nearest whole number.
Number of dishes = 28

Step 2: Calculate the remaining cutlets.
Remaining cutlets = Total number of cutlets - (Number of dishes × Number of cutlets per dish)
Remaining cutlets = 86 - (28 × 3)
Remaining cutlets = 86 - 84
Remaining cutlets = 2

Therefore, the restaurant will have 2 cutlets left over after making as many dishes as possible.
