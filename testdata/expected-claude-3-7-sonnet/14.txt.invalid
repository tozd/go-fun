To find out how many more trading cards the store sold in July compared to a normal month, I need to subtract the normal monthly sales from the July sales.

July sales - Normal monthly sales = Extra sales in July

20,777 - 10,576 = 10,201

The hobby store sold 10,201 more trading cards in July compared with a normal month.
