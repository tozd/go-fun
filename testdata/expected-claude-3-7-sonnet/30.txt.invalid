To solve this problem, I need to find the number of marbles per bag for both Lana and Markus, then calculate the difference.

Lana has 3 bags with equal numbers of marbles totaling 12 marbles.
Number of marbles per bag for Lana = 12 รท 3 = 4 marbles

Markus has 3 bags with equal numbers of marbles totaling 18 marbles.
Number of marbles per bag for Markus = 18 รท 3 = 6 marbles

The difference per bag = 6 - 4 = 2
