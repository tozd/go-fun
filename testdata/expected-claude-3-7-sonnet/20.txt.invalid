To solve this problem, I need to count all the bricks used in the construction.

First, let me count the bricks in the rows:
- 2 rows with 10 bricks in each row = 2 × 10 = 20 bricks

Next, I need to add the stacks on top of each row:
- 2 rows, each with a stack of 6 bricks on top = 2 × 6 = 12 bricks

Total number of bricks = 20 + 12 = 32

32
