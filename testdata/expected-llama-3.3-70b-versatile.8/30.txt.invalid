To find out how many marbles are in each of Lana's bags, we divide the total number of marbles by the number of bags: 12 / 3 = 4 marbles per bag.

To find out how many marbles are in each of Markus's bags, we divide the total number of marbles by the number of bags: 18 / 3 = 6 marbles per bag.

The difference in the number of marbles per bag between Markus and Lana is 6 - 4 = 2.
